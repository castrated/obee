# Naming Conventions
As you can tell, I have the world's most convoluted naming scheme going, and I'd like to clear some things up.


- The scheme is to reduce resource consumption.
- The scheme is to make things efficient and logical.
- The scheme is to make it unreadable to apes that can't fucking read.

Here, I'm going to make it easier on you fellas. May open a wiki later. For even more convolution, I'm going to call the names "tits". Short, easy-to-remember, and not in the slightest sense dirty or offensive.
